# Weather Data API Project

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that displays weather information based on user-selected dates. The user selects a day, month, and year from dropdown menus, and the application retrieves and displays weather data for that date. The project showcases skills in working with APIs, Python backend development using Flask, and frontend development with HTML and JavaScript.
